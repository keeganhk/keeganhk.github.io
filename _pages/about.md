I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Junhui Hou](https://sites.google.com/site/junhuihoushomepage/). I have also been working closely with Prof. [Ying He](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yhe/) and Prof. [Runmin Cong](https://rmcong.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.Sc. degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Beijing Normal University.
