I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Junhui Hou](https://sites.google.com/site/junhuihoushomepage/). I have also been working closely with Prof. [Ying He](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yhe/) and Prof. [Runmin Cong](https://rmcong.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.Sc. degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Beijing Normal University.

My research interests fall into the general application of machine learning techniques on 3D geometry and vision problems. Currently, I focus on the following specific topics:
* Point Cloud Processing, Shape Analysis, and Geometry Modeling;
* (Static and Dynamic) 3D Representation, Reconstruction, and Generation;
* Cross-Modal Learning between 2D and 3D Domains;
* Real-World 3D Perception (e.g., 3D Semantic Segmentation, 3D Object Detection).
